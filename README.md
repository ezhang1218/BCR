# BCR

High association rates, defined as the rate at which an antibody binds to its target, 
and the half-life of the protein-antibody complex that exceeds an apparent 
threshold are required for B cell activation. 

The association rate and half-life of the antigen-receptor both 
influence early B-cell activation, and binding site may modify 
the effect of the association rate. The proposed mathematical 
model appears to fit the data well. A larger study is needed 
to verify the findings.

# The Data

kon- the 'on' rate, or the rate at which molecules bind
koff- the 'off' rate, or the rate at which molecules disassociate
calcium_flux- a strong indicator of early B cell activation
